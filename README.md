## Introduction

DupliSweep is a simple and user-friendly application aimed at helping users find and remove duplicate files on their computer. Whether it's duplicate photos, music files, or other types of files cluttering your storage space, DupliSweep saves you time and effort by providing a comprehensive solution to clean up your file system.

 DupliSweep allows you to easily scan specific folders or directories to identify duplicate files based on criteria such as file size and hash values, thus deeming filenames irrelevent. The tkinter based user interface allows you to preview and select duplicate files for removal, freeing up valuable disk space.

## Features

- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Flexible scanning options for customizing the search criteria.
- Real-time progress updates during the scanning process.
- Preview duplicate files before taking any action.
- Remove selected duplicate files with a single click.
- Support for various file types, including documents, images, music, and more.
